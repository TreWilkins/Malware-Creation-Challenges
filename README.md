# Malware-Creation-Challenges

### Overview
This repo provides cyber-relevant challenges that intend to help newcomers to the cybersecurity realm gain a technical understanding of many of the common types of malware affecting enterprise environments and users "in the wild." There is not necessarily a final goal for this repository, at its basis, it is only one of the many options available to learn technical skills related to malware creation, detection engineering, and malware analysis. However, from a different POV, to mix up learning. 

Within this repo, challenges will be added that'll help us think about how to: 
1. Create malware payloads and campaigns.
2. Detect the inefficiencies of developed malware.
3. Respond to malware.
4. Analyze malware.
5. Mitigate existing risks by implementing tailored security configurations and leveraging available COTS and FOSS solutions.

### Additional Context
So why create this if there are already mass amounts of material available?

An issue I've noted within the cyber realm is an apparent lack of confidence and/or a focused view on the minutiae parts incidents to reach a time goal during meetings, briefs, interviews, and even general interactions with technical and non-technical personnel alike. I believe this is in part due to a lacking grip on how malware is created, how it maneuvers throughout an environment, and how related threats could be detected and mitigated. With this repo, the provided challenges are to make us think about how to create malware and create it. 

*For your situational awareness, I will never provide complete solutions in a fashion that allows copy and pasting that could falsely reassure deficiencies within the concepts of the challenges.
