# Challenge 1: Create a Ransomware Campaign

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique keys for encryption.
2. Serve a webpage that displays "Download Me."
3. On button click, serve a user environmentally-friendly payload relative to the "victims" Operating System. 
4. When the payload is executed, the contents of the "victims" download folder should be encrypted (i.e., the contents of the download folder should be inaccessible without a decryption key).
  *The encryption key must come from the script in Step 1. Encryption keys may only be utilized once.
5. Serve ransom note to the "victims" Desktop folder. The ransom note should contain: (1) a key the "victim" must provide to the malicious actor/you for file decryption, and (2) a website link the "victim" may utilize to provide the special key (contained within the ransom note) in return for the decryption key.
6. Conclude the "Ransomware Campaign" once all keys are delivered.

## Overview
Your solution may be as sophisticated or unsophisticated as you would like, so long as each item from the above list is actioned. It is highly recommended that the concept of ransomware is fundamentally understood before beginning this challenge (a quick read-up on the topic should be sufficient). This challenge is an excellent way to increase your technical understanding of a common form of malware affecting organizations today. In addition, completing this challenge can help back your technical understanding during briefs, interviews, customer consultations, and of course malware analysis. If you can create the attack, you fundamentally understand the concept of the attack. Have fun!
