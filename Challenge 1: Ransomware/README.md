# Challenge 1: Create a Ransomware Campaign

1. Write a script that generates 100 unique keys for encryption.
2. Serve a webpage that displays "Download Me."
3. On button click, serve a user environmentally-friendly payload relative to the "victims" Operating System. 
4. When the payload is executed, the contents of the "victims" download folder should be encrypted (i.e., the contents of the download folder should be inaccessible without a decryption key).
4. The encryption key must come from the script in Step 1. Encryption keys may only be utilized once.
5. Serve ransom note to the "victims" Desktop folder. The ransom note should contain: (1) a key the "victim" must provide to the malicious actor/you for file decryption, and (2) a website link the "victim" may utilize to provide the special key (contained within the ransom note) in return for the decryption key.
6. The "Ransomware Campaign" should conclude once all keys are delivered.
